# Next.js Development Skill

## Overview
This skill provides assistance with Next.js development, covering both basic and advanced concepts for building modern React applications with server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes.

## Capabilities

### 1. Project Setup & Configuration
- Initialize new Next.js projects
- Configure `next.config.js` for custom builds
- Set up TypeScript with Next.js
- Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Environment variables setup

### 2. Page Routing & Navigation
- File-based routing system (`pages` and `app` directories)
- Dynamic routes and catch-all routes
- Programmatic navigation with `router.push()`
- Link component optimization
- Custom error pages (404, 500)

### 3. Rendering Strategies
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with `getServerSideProps`
- Static Site Generation (SSG) with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`
- Client-side rendering with `SWR` or `React Query`
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Hybrid rendering approaches

### 4. Data Fetching
- API routes in `pages/api`
- Integration with REST APIs
- GraphQL integration
- Client-side data fetching patterns
- Preloading and caching strategies

### 5. Styling & Assets
- CSS Modules
- Styled JSX
- Integration with Tailwind CSS
- SCSS/SASS setup
- Image optimization with `next/image`
- Font optimization with `next/font`

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Code splitting
- Bundle analysis
- Image optimization
- Asset optimization
- Prefetching strategies

### 7. Deployment & Production
- Vercel deployment
- Custom server setup
- Environment-specific configurations
- Build optimization
- Monitoring and analytics

## Best Practices
- Component organization and composition
- State management patterns
- SEO optimization techniques
- Accessibility implementation
- Testing strategies (Jest, Cypress, React Testing Library)

## Troubleshooting
- Common build errors
- Performance bottlenecks
- Server-client rendering mismatches
- Environment configuration issues
- Routing problems
